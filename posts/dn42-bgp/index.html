DN42 allows you to experiment with mentioned internet technologies, without the logistical difficulties and high expenses of registering with real AS registries, on the live internet.\nMore importantly, if you misconfigure something, you don’t have to worry about causing global outages - like a Facebook Engineer did.\n How I connected to the mesh. The Registry The registry is based on a Git repository. This allows users to create branches \u0026 pull requests, to register, create objects and make changes to their details.\nClaiming an IP Range and AS Number. DN42 uses the 172.20.0.0/14 range for IPv4 addresses.\nAvailable IP ranges and ASNs are can be shown in the DN42 Free Explorer. It randomly shows subnets, that are free and useable, from the range.\nDN42’s recommendation is to go with a /27 subnet, which has 30 usable IP addresses, and should be sufficient for most home users.\nFollowing the same process for an ASN and IPv6, I decided to go with:\n An v4 subnet of 172.22.132.160/27 A v6 range of fd5f:2bd0:1feb::/48 An Autonomous System Number of AS4242421869  Making changes to the git repo. After cloning git the repo to my local machine, I created the following files in the data/ directory:\ndata/aut-num/AS4242421869 - the AS Number.\naut-num: AS4242421869\ras-name: AS-USMAN-DN42\radmin-c: USMAN-DN42\rtech-c: USMAN-DN42\rmnt-by: USMAN-MNT\rsource: DN42\rdata/inet6num/fd5f:2bd0:1feb::_48 - IPv6 Range.\ninet6num: fd5f:2bd0:1feb:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 - fd5f:2bd0:1feb:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff\rcidr: fd5f:2bd0:1feb::/48\rnetname: USMAN-NETWORK\rdescr: Network of Usman\radmin-c: USMAN-DN42\rtech-c: USMAN-DN42\rmnt-by: USMAN-MNT\rstatus: ASSIGNED\rsource: DN42\rdata/inetnum/172.22.132.160_27 - IPv4 Range.\ninetnum: 172.22.132.160 - 172.22.132.191\rcidr: 172.22.132.160/27\rnetname: USMAN-NETWORK\radmin-c: USMAN-DN42\rtech-c: USMAN-DN42\rmnt-by: USMAN-MNT\rstatus: ASSIGNED\rsource: DN42\rdata/mntner/USMAN-MNT - data about the maintainer, including my SSH public key (for verification purposes).\nmntner: USMAN-MNT\radmin-c: USMAN-DN42\rtech-c: USMAN-DN42\rmnt-by: USMAN-MNT\rauth: ssh-rsa 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\rsource: DN42\rdata/person/USMAN-DN42 - contact info.\nperson: Usman\re-mail: usman@email.com\rnic-hdl: USMAN-DN42\rmnt-by: USMAN-MNT\rsource: DN42\rdata/route/172.22.132.160_27 - route for v4.\nroute: 172.22.132.160/27\rorigin: AS4242421869\rmnt-by: USMAN-MNT\rsource: DN42\rdata/route6/fd5f:2bd0:1feb::_48 - route for v6.\nroute6: fd5f:2bd0:1feb::/48\rorigin: AS4242421869\rmax-length: 48\rmnt-by: USMAN-MNT\rsource: DN42\rI then ran the provided scripts to squash, verify and sign (with my public SSH key) my commits.\nOnce I pushed my commit, I created a pull request and waited for it to be approved.  My Routing Daemon. Onto the actual BGP stuff…\nThe Router. While most DN42 users opt for a Bird/Quagga routing daemon on a VPS, I chose to use my existing Ubiquiti EdgeRouter-X. It’s a great router, with a large range of features. See my other post for more info.\nPeering with Kioubit. I peered with the Kioubit Network, as they have automatic peering and a high centrality in the mesh (they have the most neighbours).\nI used Kioubit’s automatic peering wizard to register my ASN, WireGuard public key and tunnel IP. This essentially configures their UK BGP router to listen for a WireGuard peer, which has the correct key.\nWireGuard only requires one peer to have a port open, therefore I didn’t need to publicly open a port on my router.\nTheir side has also been configured to allow BGP advertisements from my ASN and advertise DN42’s prefixes, over the WireGuard tunnel.\n My Side. WireGuard Tunnel. set interfaces wireguard wg4 address 192.168.219.127/32\rset interfaces wireguard wg4 firewall in name DN42_MAIN_IN\rset interfaces wireguard wg4 firewall local name DN42_MAIN_LOCAL\rset interfaces wireguard wg4 mtu 1420\rset interfaces wireguard wg4 peer allowed-ips 0.0.0.0/0\rset interfaces wireguard wg4 peer endpoint 'uk1.g-load.eu:21869'\rset interfaces wireguard wg4 private-key set interfaces wireguard wg4 route-allowed-ips false\rWhat this does:\n Creates a virtual interface called wg4. Assigns it the IP address 192.168.219.127/37 (configured in the Kioubit’s automated peering). Sets the allowed-ips value to 0.0.0.0/0 - this requests to/from any IP address to traverse the tunnel. Defines the Kioubit’s Uk Node’s endpoint and port. Sets the route-allowed-ips value to false, so a default route doesn’t get added to the route table. Adds the interfaces to the firewall group DN42_IN \u0026 DN42_LOCAL more on this later   BGP Peering. set protocols bgp 4242421869 neighbor 172.20.53.104 description kioubit\rset protocols bgp 4242421869 neighbor 172.20.53.104 ebgp-multihop 255\rset protocols bgp 4242421869 neighbor 172.20.53.104 remote-as 4242423914\rset protocols bgp 4242421869 neighbor 172.20.53.104 soft-reconfiguration inbound\rset protocols bgp 4242421869 neighbor 172.20.53.104 update-source 172.22.132.161\rWhat this does:\n Enables the BGP routing daemon with my ASN 4242421869. Sets the remote remote AS, with a neighbour IP as 172.20.43.104(kioubit’s IP address in WG tunnel). Sets eBGP Multihop to 255 hops - this is required as the peering is established over a VPN tunnel, not a direct connection.   Other BGP and Routing settings. set protocols bgp 4242421869 network 172.22.132.160/27\rset protocols bgp 4242421869 parameters router-id 172.22.132.161\rset protocols static interface-route 172.20.53.104/32 next-hop-interface wg4\rWhat this does:\n Advertises the 172.22.132.160/27 prefix (my DN42 subnet). Sets the router ID (which is advertised to peers) to 172.22.132.161. Created a static interface route for Kioubit’s address 172.20.53.104, via wg4.   Firewall Rules and security. I used firewall rules to limit the traffic between my network and DN42.\nUbiquiti’s firewalling works by having different ‘directions’. IN and LOCAL.\n  IN Matches on established/related and invalid traffic that is passed through the router (WAN to LAN).\n  LOCAL Matches on established/related and invalid traffic that is destined for the router itself (WAN to LOCAL).\n  DN42_MAIN_IN. set firewall name DN42_MAIN_IN default-action drop\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_IN rule 1 action accept\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_IN rule 1 description 'Allow established/related'\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_IN rule 1 log disable\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_IN rule 1 protocol all\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_IN rule 1 state established enable\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_IN rule 1 state invalid disable\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_IN rule 1 state new disable\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_IN rule 1 state related enable\rThe IN ruleset has a default action to drop any packets, and only allow any traffic that is established/related. Meaning only any traffic that is initiated from a device in my LAN (not the router) will be allowed.\nIf I wanted to host any services for any other DN42 members, this is where I would add another rule to allow traffic to a specific host \u0026 port. Along with a port forward to bypass NAT.\nDN42_MAIN_LOCAL. set firewall name DN42_MAIN_LOCAL default-action drop\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_LOCAL rule 1 action accept\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_LOCAL rule 1 description 'Allow established/related'\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_LOCAL rule 1 log disable\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_LOCAL rule 1 protocol all\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_LOCAL rule 1 state established enable\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_LOCAL rule 1 state invalid disable\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_LOCAL rule 1 state new disable\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_LOCAL rule 1 state related enable\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_LOCAL rule 2 action accept\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_LOCAL rule 2 description 'Allow BGP'\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_LOCAL rule 2 destination port 179\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_LOCAL rule 2 log disable\rset firewall name DN42_MAIN_LOCAL rule 2 protocol tcp\rThe local ruleset also has the same default action and established/related rule. I also have a rule to allow incoming TCP connections on port 179, for BGP.\nThis is where I would create another rule if I wanted to allow DN42 members to access something directly on the router. For example, SSH for administrative purposes.\n Source NAT. I also implemented NAT so that I can access DN42 from any device in my LAN.\nset service nat rule 5050 description 'source NAT for DN42 Peer Kioubit'\rset service nat rule 5050 log disable\rset service nat rule 5050 outbound-interface wg4\rset service nat rule 5050 outside-address address 172.22.132.162\rset service nat rule 5050 protocol all\rset service nat rule 5050 source\rset service nat rule 5050 type source\rConnections destined for the DN42 prefix, will be NAT’ed through the address 172.22.132.162 (one of the IPs in my claimed range).\nFor example, my Raspberry Pi (which is in a local VLAN) can access the DN42 network and run a traceroute to a DN42 IP.\n Maps. At the moment, I have connections with 5 peers. This improves redundancy and provides better access to all areas of the mesh. ",

<p>DN42 is a big network, which employs WAN technologies (BGP, whois database, DNS, etc) to create an internet like mesh.</p>
<p>Members connect to each other using VPN tunnels (GRE, OpenVPN, WireGuard, IPsec) and exchange routes via BGP.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/DN42/map.JPG" alt="DN42 Mesh"  title="DN42 Mesh"  />
</p>
<p><em>DN42 currently has 410 nodes/users, advertising ~600 prefixes. <a href="https://map42.0x7f.cc/">realtime map</a></em></p>

<h2 id="why-dn42">Why DN42?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-dn42">#</a></h2>
<p>DN42 allows you to experiment with mentioned internet technologies, without the logistical difficulties and high expenses of registering with real AS registries, on the live internet.</p>
<p>More importantly, if you misconfigure something, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about causing global outages - <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/">like a Facebook Engineer did.</a></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/DN42/gitrepo.JPG" alt="DN42 Git Registry"  title="DN42 Git Registry"  />

The registry is based on a <a href="https://git.dn42.dev/dn42/registry/">Git repository</a>. This allows users to create branches &amp; pull requests, to register, create objects and make changes to their details.</p>
<h3 id="claiming-an-ip-range-and-as-number">Claiming an IP Range and AS Number.<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#claiming-an-ip-range-and-as-number">#</a></h3>
<p>DN42 uses the <code>172.20.0.0/14</code> range for IPv4 addresses.</p>
<p>Available IP ranges and ASNs are can be shown in the <a href="https://explorer.burble.com/free#/">DN42 Free Explorer.</a> It randomly shows subnets, that are free and useable, from the range.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/DN42/free-explorer.JPG" alt="DN42 Free Explorer"  title="DN42 Free Explorer"  />
</p>
<p>DN42&rsquo;s recommendation is to go with a <code>/27</code> subnet, which has 30 usable IP addresses, and should be sufficient for most home users.</p>
<p>Following the same process for an ASN and IPv6, I decided to go with:</p>
<ul>
<li>An v4 subnet of <code>172.22.132.160/27</code></li>
<li>A v6 range of <code>fd5f:2bd0:1feb::/48</code></li>
<li>An Autonomous System Number of <code>AS4242421869</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-router">The Router.<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-router">#</a></h3>
<p>While most DN42 users opt for a Bird/Quagga routing daemon on a VPS, I chose to use my existing Ubiquiti EdgeRouter-X. It&rsquo;s a great router, with a large range of features. <a href="https://blog.usman.network/posts/wireguard-vpn-on-a-ubiquiti-edgerouter/"><em>See my other post for more info.</em></a></p>
<h3 id="peering-with-kioubit">Peering with Kioubit.<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#peering-with-kioubit">#</a></h3>
<p>I peered with the <a href="https://dn42.g-load.eu/">Kioubit Network</a>, as they have automatic peering and a high centrality in the mesh (they have the most neighbours).</p>
<p>I used Kioubit&rsquo;s automatic peering wizard to register my ASN, WireGuard public key and tunnel IP. 
<img loading="lazy" src="/images/DN42/kioubit-reg.JPG" alt="Registering Kioubit"  title="Kioubit Registration"  />

This essentially configures their UK BGP router to listen for a WireGuard peer, which has the correct key.</p>
<p>WireGuard only requires one peer to have a port open, therefore I didn&rsquo;t need to publicly open a port on my router.</p>
<p>Their side has also been configured to allow BGP advertisements from my ASN  and advertise DN42&rsquo;s prefixes, over the WireGuard tunnel.</p>
